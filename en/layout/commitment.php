                At Inase, you can dine in peace of mind with safe and delicious ingredients. The majority are sourced directly from privately contracted domestic suppliers. They include rare, pure-bred Agu pork from Okinawa; reduced-pesticide vegetables from Hida Takayama; and same-day-sourced fresh seafood from Toyosu Market.<br>
                We prepare all these ingredients, selected by our master chef, with the utmost care and passion, so that you can fully enjoy the seasonal flavors of Japan.<br>

                Some people can’t or won’t eat meat. Some have food allergies. And others insist on strict nutritional balance. Here, they can all enjoy eating at the same table. That’s the Inase ideal. Whether you want vegan and vegetarian, high protein, or low calorie, our menu has something for everyone.
